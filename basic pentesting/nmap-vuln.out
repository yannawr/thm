|   VULNERABLE:
|   Slowloris DOS attack
|     State: LIKELY VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2007-6750
|       Slowloris tries to keep many connections to the target web server open and hold
|       them open as long as possible.  It accomplishes this by opening connections to
|       the target web server and sending a partial request. By doing so, it starves
|       the http server's resources causing Denial Of Service.

|     State: VULNERABLE
|       The service regsvc in Microsoft Windows 2000 systems is vulnerable to denial of service caused by a null deference
|       pointer. This script will crash the service if it is vulnerable. This vulnerability was discovered by Ron Bowes
|       while working on smb-enum-sessions.
